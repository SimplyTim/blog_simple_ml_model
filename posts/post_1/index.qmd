Welcome to this blog on creating a Simple Machine Learning model. Let us go into the basics of Machine Learning before we start the tutorial.

You might have heard the terms "machine learning" and "artifical intelligence," but what are they exactly?

Well, **Machine Learning** refers to subset of Arifical Intelligence that focuses on having a computer learn from data to find patterns/ trends or make predictions. This is achieved by using "models". 
There are several types of models, which all excel in different types of tasks. In this case, we want a model that assigns data to a particular category. The names of such models are:

* Logistic Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbours
* Decision Trees
* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machines

More generally, **Artificial Intelligence** is a broad field in Computer Science that focuses on developing systems that can simulate human intelligence by performing actions or solving problems. According to [Statistica](https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/artificial-intelligence/worldwide#), the global market size of Artifical Intelligence is projected to reach US$243.7B in 2025!

Here are some examples of popular AI systems that are used today. You may have heard of some of them!

* [DALL-E](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-2/)
